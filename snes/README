SNES Menu Compilation

This directory contains all code for the SD2SNES menu navigation.

snescom (Version 1.7.4) is required. It can be downloaded here: https://bisqwit.iki.fi/source/snescom.html

To Compile, libboot-dev-all should be installed, then make & make install in the snescom directory.

After installing snescom, call make in this directory to build the SD2SNES menu.

Copy the resulting file "menu.bin" to <sdcard>/sd2snes/menu.bin.
